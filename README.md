<h2> Hello, I'm backend developer gyunam Kim. ðŸ‘‹ </h2>


<h3>1. I love the code.</h3>

- I'm excited every moment I write the code.
- I try to be closer to the code.

<h3>2. Collaboration is important to me.</h3>

- I enjoy the process of improving the quality of code and filling gaps through collaboration.
- I aim for the growth of the company and the team, not personal growth.

<h3>3. I am oriented toward refactoring and clean code.</h3>
  
- I try to write code that other people can read while collaborating.
- I try not to write unnecessary code.
- I try to reduce potential bugs.
  
<h3>4. Design is important to me.</h3>

- I'm thinking about a design that is easy to expand and change, and is reusable.
- I think of a clear interest, a high degree of cohesion and a low degree of cohesion.
- I think good design leads to a good user experience soon.

<h3>5. I always think about business.</h3>

- Develop and improve not just by developing, but by considering the essential business.
- I think we should pay attention to business beyond the narrow perspective of thinking only about applications because each person has different values.
